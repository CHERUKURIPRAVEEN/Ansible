 ### What is Ansible
Ansible is an open source IT automation tool that automates provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, orchestration, and many other manual IT processes.

### Use Cases of Ansible
- Automation(Any system automation, Server, Database, configuration, start restart services)
- Change Management (Production server changes)
- Provisionning(Setup server from scratch or cloud provisioning)
- Orchestration(Large scale automation framework, can integrate with other tool like jenkins, docker)

### How Ansible connect to remote machines

**Control machine**: A control machine is the central node in an Ansible infrastructure. It is used to manage all the other machines in the network. 

**Remote machine**: A remote machine is any machine that is not the control machine. Remote machines are managed by the control machine using SSH. 

**Target machine**: A target machine is a remote machine being provisioned or configured by Ansible.
### What is Ansible Playbook
Playbooks are the files where the Ansible code is written. Playbooks are written in YAML format. YAML means "Yet Another Markup Language,".
It is basically a blueprint of automation tasks—which are complex IT actions executed with limited or no human involvement.

### What is Ansible Inventory
Inventory file defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate. The file can be in one of many formats depending on your Ansible environment and plugins. The default inventory located at /etc/ansible/hosts

### What is Ansible Config file
The file that governs the behavior of all interactions performed by the control node. In Ansible’s case that default configuration file is (ansible.cfg) located in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg. 

Ansible uses the python module, python script to connect to the target machine. It dumps the python script and execute there and return the output.

### Hands-on:
- Launch an EC2 instance and install Ansible ( This is the control machine)
- Launch more EC2 instances to manage them 
- Create a inventory file in your control machine in Project directory
- Don't give password instead give private key 

### Hosts Entry in Inventory file

```
host_name ansible_host=private_addr ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=instance.pem 
```

Ansible provide ad-hoc commands to execute module on target from the shell. Ping will do ssh into Linux machine, if it's succesful it means connection between ansible and hosts are right.
- For particular host use host_name in below command:
```
ansible -i inventory -m ping host_name
```
- For all hosts use below commands:
```
ansible -i inventory -m ping all
```
```
ansible -i inventory -m ping '*'
```

Add servers in group in Inventory file to manage all at once instead of executing commands for each server.
```
host_name1 ansible_host=private_addr ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=instance.pem 
host_name2 ansible_host=private_addr ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=instance.pem 
host_name3 ansible_host=private_addr ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=instance.pem 
-----Group-----
[webserver]
host_name1
host_name2
[dbserver]
host_name3
-----Group of Groups----
[AllServers:children]
webserver
dbserver
-----Variables at group level---
[AllServers:vars]
ansible_user=ubuntu
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=instance.pem 
```
Install httpd in web01 (use --become tp elevate rights as ubuntu user doesn't have permission to install https service)
```
ansible -i inventory -m apt-get -a "name-httpd state-present" host_name1 --become
```
Modules are idempotent in ansible meaning if you run a playbook with the same set of inputs, you should not expect it to make any changes on the system.

### Ansible playbook
Write playbook to install httpd in webserver[host_name1,host_name2] from inventory file:

```
---
- name: Setup webserver
  hosts: webserver
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd
      yum:
         name: httpd
         state: present 
    - name: Copy html file     
      copy:
         src: index.html
         dest: /www/html/index.html
```
### Command to check playbook:
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook_name.yml --syntax-chcek
```
### Command to run playbook:
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook_name.yml
```
### To find use of any module
```
ansible-doc module_name
```
To know more about modules search it in official Ansible documentation

### Ansible Configuration
Change the default behaviour of ansible configuration by editing coniguration file

#### Order of Ansible Config
- ANSIBLE_CONFIG (set environment variable)
- ansible.cfg (in the current directory)
- ~/.ansible.cfg (in the home directory)
- /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

## Variables
Vars defines the variables which you can use in your playbook. Its usage is similar to the variables in any programming language.
Example:vars:
```
- name: Setup webserver
  hosts: webserver
  vars:
     http_port: 80
```
We can define inventory based variables in the below path that's applicable globally for all hosts:
- group_vars/all
- group_vars/groupname
- host_vars/hostname

#### Fact variables:
Fact variables are runtime variables that get generated when setup module gets executed such as
- ansible_os_family
- ansible_processor_cores
- ansible_kernel
- ansible_default_ipv4

### Commands to execute setup module
```
ansible -m setup hostname 
```
### Use debug module in Ansible is to prints simple statements to stdout
```
- name: Printing ansible distribution
  hosts: all
  tasks: 
     - name: Print 
       debug:
          var: ansible_distribution

```        
### Conditions
Conditions in playbook are same as 'if/else' conditions in programming, use **when** in Ansible:   
Syntax: 
```
      tasks:
         - name: Install httpd service Ubuntu
           yum: 
             name: httpd
             state: present
           when: ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'
         - name: Install httpd service Centos 
           apt:
             name: httpd
             state: present
           when: ansible_distribution == 'Centos'
```    
### Loops
Loops are used to iterate the condition in playbook for diffrent servers:
Syntax:
```
    tasks:
         - name: Install httpd service Ubuntu
           yum: 
             name: "{{item}}"
             state: present
           when: ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'
           loop:
             - httpd
             - git
             - zip
         - name: Install httpd service Centos 
           apt:
             name: "{{item}}"
             state: present
             update_cache: yes
           when: ansible_distribution == 'Centos'
           loop:
             - httpd
             - git
             - zip
 ```     
### Handlers
Sometimes you want a task to run only when a change is made on a machine. For example, you may want to restart a service if a task updates the configuration of that service, but not if the configuration is unchanged. Ansible uses handlers to address this use case. Handlers are tasks that only run when notified.
            
```
---
- name: Verify apache installation
  hosts: webservers
  vars:
    http_port: 80
    max_clients: 200
  remote_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure apache is at the latest version
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: httpd
        state: latest

    - name: Write the apache config file
      ansible.builtin.template:
        src: /srv/httpd.j2
        dest: /etc/httpd.conf
      notify:
      - Restart apache

    - name: Ensure apache is running
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd
        state: started

  handlers:
    - name: Restart apache
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
```

### Ansible Roles
In Ansible, the role is the primary mechanism for breaking a playbook into multiple files. This simplifies writing complex playbooks, and it makes them easier to reuse.

#### Command to create role
To create ansible role, use ansible-galaxy init <role_name> to create the role directory structure.
```
ansible-galaxy init <role_name>
```
### Ansible for AWS
Ansible is an open source tool that you can use to automate your AWS deployments. You can use it to define, deploy, and manage applications and services using automation playbooks. These playbooks enable you to define configurations once and deploy those configurations consistently across environments.

#### Steps:
- Create IAM user.
- Authentication: Use AWS access key and secret access key as either module arguments or environmental (ENV) variables (Export keys).
- Write playbook
- Execute it
